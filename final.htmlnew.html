			<p>In April 2019, a member of the public sent in an FOIA request that asked for information from the Monroe County, NY, District Attorney’s Office. They wanted to see the total list of expenses by the DA’s Office from 2014-19, a list that is made up of employee salaries, travel and meal expenses, and any other purchases made by/for the department.</p><p>In analyzing the data, it was found that salaries are overwhelmingly what the DA’s Office’s budget consists of. Yet the total amount of salaries paid each year hit a stark drop off from 2018 to 2019 after it had initially been increasing year in and year out. Plus, expenses for less necessary items and activities increased annually during the six-year period. When compared to even more recent data from the department, each of these findings help reflect the current state of the Monroe County DA Office's budget.</p>

			<h3>A large salary dip</h3>
			<p>During this six-year sample that was provided via the FOIA request, the DA Office’s salaries initially were increasing for every single year. In 2014, there was $8,685,478.64 for salaries in the department. The total grew each calendar year, resulting in $9,241,490.81 allocated for salaries in 2018.</p><p>But then, 2019 saw an over $2 million reduction in total salaries, shrinking to $7,231,094.02. Director of Community Relations at the Monroe County District Attorney’s Office, Calli Marinetti, originally disputed the data, stating that salaries in their office have “only increased since 2018.” Though she said that the cause for the large reduction in total salaries in that short, sudden period was due to people on the higher end of pay grades retiring and many new ADA attorneys coming into the office. </p>

			<p>According to the <a href="https://www.monroecounty.gov/finance-budget"target="_blank">Monroe County, NY, budget records</a>, which are available to the public, salaries for the employees and lawyers in the department increase on a yearly basis with tenure there. So, a reasonable explanation for this rapid salary drop is that younger, less experienced ADAs were getting paid a lesser amount than the older, now-retired attorneys were getting paid before 2019.</p><p>Heather Holcomb, the Assistant Professor of Accounting at SUNY Oswego, said the first place to look when you see such a steep decrease in salaries is if the DA’s Office lost funding and therefore, had to give out pay cuts. And even though the salary dropoff happened right before COVID-19, when funds would have been expected to be slashed, the Monroe County DA Office budget increased year by year after the large dropoff in 2019. In 2020, during the pandemic, the total budget increased from just over $15 million, to over $16 million. Salaries also went back up by a little less than $2 million, a sign that the newer ADAs were beginning to be paid more with seniority, rather than a loss of funding. </p><p>The pandemic loss started to kick in the following year in 2021, as the overall budget decreased by just over $100,000. But salaries maintained at a similar level, actually increasing by over $250,000. Since then, the overall budget has still only gotten larger, moving to over $17 million in 2022 and over $19 million in 2023 (though the budget hasn’t been finalized yet on the Monroe County website since the year is ongoing). The massive salary reduction from 2018-19 can be attributed to newer employees coming in to replace older employees that were being paid more upon retirement, as seen with how quickly the DA’s Office recovered from the dip and went back to increasing its budget by the year. </p>

			<h3>Increasing travel costs</h3>
			<p>While salaries have overall continued to increase despite one outlier year, travel costs had also picked up annually with a large drop off in 2019 as well. From 2014-18, travel expenses in the Monroe County District Attorney’s Office went from $6,512 all the way up to $24,935. Then, they hit a stark drop off of $17,888 in 2019. While that number is a steep decrease, it is still a much larger amount than in 2014.</p>

			<p>Holcomb hypothesized that the money could have been used for attorney’s to travel for their own cases. But, Monroe County’s District Attorney’s Office only deals with cases around the county. The funds are more primarily distributed to vacation travel for those who are employed by the office. As their salaries grew, more taxpayer money was being allocated for vacations. </p><p>“It’s kind of a double edged sword. This is all public information,” Holcomb said. “There’s a huge financial responsibility because you’re not managing your own money, right? You’re using taxpayer money.</p><p> “The other part of it is there’s not really many citizens who either look at the information or know how to read it. We should be, as tax paying citizens, keeping an eye on the people we are electing and what they’re approving and what they’re spending.” </p><p>From the six-year dataset and on, employee benefits have only increased since (while staying in the $4 million range), even through the pandemic. Government travel paid by the funds of taxpayers has grown with time, and is a nation-wide issue. Back as recently as August, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/16/us/politics/desantis-campaign-costs.html"target="_blank">according to the New York Times</a>, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis reportedly raised his travel and security expenses by nearly 70% in a year. As Holcomb mentioned, the average member of the public may not understand how to utilize public resources to figure out what their taxpayer dollars are going toward in the government. And that lack of awareness provides leeway for government employees to take advantage of what they’re being given in a budget.</p>

			<h3>Conclusions</h3>
			<p>Government spending is difficult for the public to regulate. Those who set the laws have the ability to set their own salaries and budget. It makes these two specific findings extremely significant in showing how the government can always stay ahead financially. The total amount of salaries in the Monroe County DA’s Office increased steadily, then stalled in 2019, then grew back to what it once was and even greater the following year. Even through COVID-19, attorney’s were being paid more and more each cycle.</p><p>And from the six-year period that was focused on, travel payments for vacations increased nearly every single calendar year. Nationally, the government has persisted in spending large amounts of taxpayer dollars on expenses that are less necessary, such as former President Donald Trump’s extremely expensive <a href=”https://www.forbes.com/sites/chuckjones/2019/07/10/trumps-golf-trips-could-cost-taxpayers-over-340-million/?sh=7c4e24cc28aa” target=_”blank”>golf outings</a> that he frequently took while in the White House. Monroe County increasing its wages and expenses through turnover and a pandemic is a microcosm of what governmental bodies across the United States can do in terms of spending taxpayer money at large scales. </p>
